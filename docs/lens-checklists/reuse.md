# Lens checklist: Reuse and utilities

Source: AGENTS.md

## Checklist

- [ ] Existing UI blocks/components are reused before adding new ones.
- [ ] New helpers are small, named clearly, and scoped to real reuse.
- [ ] Duplicate logic is avoided across routes/components.
- [ ] Content-driven changes prefer MDX/content edits over code rewrites.
