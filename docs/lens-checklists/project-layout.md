# Lens checklist: Project layout

Source: AGENTS.md and README.md

## Checklist

- [ ] App Router structure is respected (`app`, `components`, `content`, `lib`, `scripts`, `tests`).
- [ ] Business content stays in `content/site.json` and `content/pages/*.mdx`.
- [ ] Reusable sections live in `components/blocks/*`; primitives in `components/ui/*`.
- [ ] Build/tooling changes are minimal and justified.
