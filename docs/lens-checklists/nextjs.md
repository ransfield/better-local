# Lens checklist: Next.js

Source: project conventions

## Checklist

- [ ] Server components are preferred; `"use client"` is used only when needed.
- [ ] Metadata and canonical behavior remain correct for page routes.
- [ ] Route params and external inputs are validated at boundaries.
- [ ] Contact form behavior fails gracefully when env vars are missing.
- [ ] Accessibility basics are preserved (single H1 strategy, labels, semantic headings).
