## Built from a proven template, tailored to your business

BetterLocal is designed for non-ecommerce local businesses that need to get online quickly without reinventing everything.

We use a proven base template, customise your message and pages, then share a preview link so you can review before anything goes live.

## How delivery works

- We start with a tested structure instead of custom-building from zero
- We tailor message hierarchy to your actual services and service area
- We share preview links early so decisions happen before go-live
- We launch a useful v1, then improve in practical monthly cycles
