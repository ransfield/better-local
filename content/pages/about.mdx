    <p className="mt-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-neutral-700 md:text-lg">
      BetterLocal is a service from Better Digital, built specifically for local businesses - trades, clinics, hospitality, and professional services - that need a website and online presence without the complexity.
    </p>
    <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-neutral-700 md:text-lg">
      Many local businesses still rely on social-only presence, outdated websites, or disconnected marketing activity that does not reliably turn into enquiries.
    </p>
    <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-neutral-700 md:text-lg">
      We are based in New Zealand and work with businesses that need clear execution, not agency theatre.

    How we work
  </h2>
  <p className="mt-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-neutral-700 md:text-lg">
    We launch fast using a tested template - not from scratch every time. You get a live preview link to check before anything goes public. After launch, we keep improving based on what is actually working. Where AI saves time, like writing drafts or updating listings, we use it - but the decisions stay with you.
