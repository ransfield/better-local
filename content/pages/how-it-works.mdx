# How It Works

> "No long discovery phase. No endless revisions. Just a clear route to launch."

## A practical process built for local businesses

We keep the process straightforward so you can go live quickly without getting stuck in long revisions.
</Section>

## Step 1: Local Presence Audit

We review where you are now and what matters most:

- current online presence (or lack of one)
- services and locations you want to target
- best call to action for your business (call, quote, booking)

Then we recommend a clear first version that can launch in days, not weeks.

## Step 2: Build and Tailor

We tailor a proven site structure to your business:

- service-focused page content
- clear messaging and trust-building sections
- contact flow setup for enquiries
- mobile-first layout checks
</Section>

## Step 3: Review and Launch

Before launch we run quality checks, confirm links and metadata, and then publish.

You get a polished site that is fast, clear, and ready for real customer enquiries.

## What we need from you

To keep delivery fast, we usually need:

- your logo (or we can use a clean text mark)
- service list and service area
- photos (if available)
- contact details and preferred call to action
</Section>

## After launch

You can choose what happens next:

- one-off handover with guidance for simple updates
- occasional updates when offers/services change
- ongoing support for content refreshes and small improvements
